            <h2>Are you and your Horses Prepared for Winter?  Get ready with these tips!</h2>
            <h4>by: Andrew Scott</h4>
            <p>When October leaves start falling, you know that winter will soon be knocking on your barn door. And in
                many parts of the country, that means below-freezing temperatures, snow and ice, slush and mud.
                Sometimes the bad weather arrives surprisingly early, so to avoid having to struggle to catch up when
                cold winds are blowing, get started on your winter preparations now:</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">1. Protect medications.</h6>
            <p>Check the labels of all injectable, topical and oral medications for information about proper storage.
                Many cannot withstand cold temperatures and will become useless, if not harmful, if they freeze. Either
                store cold-sensitive products in a climate-controlled tack room, or take them to your house for the
                winter. (While you're at it, check the expiration dates and replace any products that have gotten too
                old.) If you're unsure whether one of your drugs is still safe, ask your veterinarian. She can also
                advise you on how to properly dispose of old or damaged products.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">2. Test water heaters</h6>
            <p>Before temperatures hit freezing, make sure any heaters you use for your buckets and troughs are working
                properly. Turn the heaters on and check the water temperature, then monitor the water meter to ensure
                your horses are drinking normally. If your horses' water intake seems to be below normal, investigate
                the possibility that you have a stray voltage problem.
            </p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">3. Insulate your hand tools.</h6>
            <p>Slip pieces of foam pipe insulation over the handles of shovels, rakes, wheelbarrows and other barn
                tools, especially those made of metal, to prevent frost and help protect your hands. Use duct tape to
                secure the insulation in place so it doesn't slip as you work.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">4. Stock up on snow supplies.</h6>
            <p>A number of substances---salt, sand, ash, nonclumping clay cat litter---are useful for providing traction
                on icy footing. Salt is better at melting ice, but it can also kill vegetation and burn unprotected
                paws. Sand and ash are safer but can slow the melting process once temperatures start to rise and are
                very messy. Whichever choice you make, stock up long before snow is in the forecast. While you're at it,
                replace any older or broken snow shovels, scrapers, deicers or other winter hand tools.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">5. Stockpile hay, feeds and necessary supplies.</h6>
            <p>It's a good idea to have extras of all necessities on hand in case winter storms make deliveries or trips
                to the feed store impossible. How much hay you'll need to store depends on many factors, including how
                cold it's projected to be and how long your pasture can be grazed, but a good rule of thumb is to buy
                about 10 percent more than you think you'll need. Also keep about two extra weeks' worth of feeds and
                supplements on hand just be sure to check expiration dates. You don't want to buy more of a supplement
                than you can use before it expires. Make sure your first aid kit has anything you might need in an
                emergency, and stock up on any medications or bandages you use regularly, for a horse with a chronic
                illness or injury, for example.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">6. Inspect your blankets.</h6>
            <p>Even if you cleaned and stored your blankets properly at the end of last season, it's a good idea to take
                them out and have a look at them well before you'll need them again. Mold, insects or rodents may have
                gotten to them while they were in storage. Check for loose straps, frayed fabric, holes or foul smells,
                and repair or replace any blankets that need attention.</p>
            <p>Also make sure each garment still fits properly. Youngsters, athletes, seniors or laid-up horses may have
                gained or lost a significant amount of weight over the summer and may not be able to wear the same
                blanket again. A properly fitting blanket allows a hand to fit snugly under and slide around along the
                shoulder, withers and rump.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">7. Prepare your horse's feet.</h6>
            <p>If you're going to pull your horse's shoes for the winter, it's best to do it while the weather is still
                warmer, so he can acclimate before the ground is frozen hard. If you're going to keep him shod
                throughout the winter, consult with your farrier about your shoeing choices. If the footing will be
                slick, some horses may do better with traction devices, such as studs or borium. Snowball pads may also
                be necessary, to prevent wet snow from getting packed in under his feet.</p>
                <p>Winter weather can sweep in unexpectedly. But if you prepare now, you'll be ready to relax and enjoy the best
                        the season has to offer, knowing that your property is safe and your horses are cozy.</p>
