            <h2>Fishing!  So many benefits so little time.</h2>
            <h4>by: Hunter Lizano</h4>
            <p>Give a man a fish and feed him for a day. But teach a man how to fish and he’ll be healthy for life! Read
                the top 10 health benefits of fishing below to learn why this classic hobby is also great way to improve
                mental and physical well-being.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">Full Body Strength</h6>
            <p>The protagonist in Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea battles a great marlin for 3 days. That’s one
                strong dude. Your average hobbyist won’t be called on to strain day and night to reel in an adversary.
                But battling even a small fish calls engages the shoulders, back, arms, core and legs in an excruciating
                workout. Fishing encourages sportsmen and women to train their body so that they have the strength when
                the time comes for the big catch.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">Family Bonding</h6>
            <p>Fishing is a skill passed on through the generations, with grandfathers taking the younger kids out to a
                familiar pond and instructing them how to hook a worm. Spending time with your family promotes feelings
                of security and well-being, making fishing a worthwhile activity to learn.
            </p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">Boosts Immune System</h6>
            <p> Vitamin D helps your body regulate the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, two minerals that improve
                immune system function and help defend against disease. The best source of vitamin D is a day outdoors
                under the sun.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">Improves Cardiovascular Health</h6>
            <p>Fishing burns an average of 200 calories an hour, depending on the kind of fishing you like to do. Maybe
                it isn’t true if you are sitting around with a cooler of beer and a king-size bag of jerky. But if you
                are walking around to test out different spots, recasting your line, and (fingers crossed) reeling in a
                fish, you’ll have put your heart and lungs to work.Geto deal with different weather situations,
                different terrains and all the activity
            </p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">Teaches Self-Reliance</h6>
            <p>In our service-oriented economy we rely on others to perform all kinds of functions in our daily lives.
                Fishing puts you out in the wilderness and calls on you to master a variety of different skills. The
                more involved you get in the sport the more you’ll learn: from driving a boat to hunting down tackle.
                This impromptu trouble shooting will spill over into your normal life. If you can fix your rod with just
                your ingenuity, what else can you do on your own?</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">Bestows Patience</h6>
            <p>In our world of over-stimulation and instant gratification, fishing puts your patience to practice.
                Unless you are extraordinarily lucky, you don’t just drop your line in and hook a fish. Some days (and
                even some trips) you go home empty-handed. But persisting makes you a more patient person, accepting of
                defeat but unwilling to quit.
                M.J. Ryan, the author of “The Power of Patience,” explains that learning patience benefits health.
                Impatience causes stress, weakening your immune system and raising your blood pressure. Patience,
                meanwhile, makes you calmer and more content.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">Enjoy The Great Outdoors</h6>
            <p>Fishing inspires a closer connection with nature and all the creatures in it. Fisher are tuned in to the
                harmonious ecosystems in coastal environments. They know all about the different fish that live in the
                water, the insects they eat, and their predators. The exposure to fresh air, sun, and being on the water
                has numerous health benefits.</p>
            <h6 class="articleSubHead">Improves Balance</h6>
            <p>As anyone who has ever reeled a catfish in to a canoe can tell you, fishing requires some acrobatic
                maneuvers. Balance requires core strength and benefits flexibility, both of which help offset backpain.
