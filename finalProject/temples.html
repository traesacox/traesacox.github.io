                    Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Located near the La Jolla community of San Diego, it was built
                    with two main spires, but unique to this temple are four smaller spires at the base of each main
                    spire. The East spire is topped with the familiar Angel Moroni statue which adorns most LDS temples.

                    December 2010. Ground was broken on May 12, 2012, with the dedication on March 20, 2016.</p>
