            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <h3>Power of Families</h3>

            <img src="images/POFOptionsScreenshotOptimized.jpg" alt="screenshot of PowerOfFamilies Website">
            <p>The website PowerOfFamilies.com is a good example of Fitt’s Law which says that the bigger the object and
                the closer it is the easier it is to use. The selection options are large circles that are centered on
                the screen making it very easy to understand the options and the navigation. Additionally it is
                surrounded by white space making the focus completely centered on the large options.</p>

            <h2>P.A.R.C - Contrast</h2>
            <h3>Glow Zone</h3>
            <div><a href="https://www.glowzone.us">Glow Zone Website</a></div>
            <img src="images/GlowZoneScreenShotOptimized.jpg" alt="screenshot of PowerOfFamilies Website">
            <p>The Glow Zone website is vibrant with extreme contract. The stark white against the black pops out to
                grab your attention. Additionally the neon green and purple offer contrast that speaks to the product
                being offered. The colors work well to show a sense of excitement and fun. Although the font used in
                some places is difficult to read, the overall use of contract works well to sell the idea of glowing
                fun.

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <h3>Pella Windows and Doors</h3>
            <div><a href="https://www.pella.com">Pella Website</a></div>
            <img src="images/PellaScreenShotOptimized.jpg" alt="screenshot of PowerOfFamilies Website">
            <p>The Pella Windows and Doors website utilized well Hick’s Law which states that every additional choice
                increases the required time to make a decision. Pella has eliminated any distraction of multiple
                decisions and placed the button to request an in home estimate the main option on the page. Your
                attention is completely focused on that one button using its location and colors. Eliminating other
                options drive the user to want to click the button.</p>
